# Autosre-Port-Driver
# Overview
This project implements a Port Driver conforming to the AUTOSAR (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) standard. The Port Driver is responsible for configuring and controlling the microcontroller's ports, including setting the direction, mode, and initial value for each pin. It is designed to be used in automotive applications where standardization and reliability are crucial.

# Features
AUTOSAR Compliance: The driver adheres to the AUTOSAR standard, ensuring compatibility with other AUTOSAR components.
Pin Configuration: Supports configuring the direction (input/output), mode (digital/analog), and initial value for each pin on the microcontroller.
Port Initialization: Allows for the initialization of ports based on a predefined configuration, ensuring consistent setup across different modules.
Scalability: Easily configurable to accommodate different microcontroller types and pin configurations.
Error Handling: Includes mechanisms for detecting and reporting configuration errors, improving system robustness.

# Technical Specifications
Configuration Structure: Uses a structured approach to define pin configurations, allowing for easy modification and scaling.
Modular Design: The driver is designed in a modular way to integrate seamlessly with other AUTOSAR software components.
